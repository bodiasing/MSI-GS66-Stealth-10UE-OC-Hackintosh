#### To enter the Advanced BIOS
Not necessarily, but I updated the BIOS on the latest version of E16V3IMS.111, and undervolted -105 mv.
While in the BIOS, press F2, Left ALT, Right SHIFT, Right CTRL
Now you can verify that DVMT Pre-Allocated is set to 64MB and DVMT Total Gfx Mem is set to Max
Also, and most important, set CFG Lock to Disabled, to enable native PM (also you would probably get a KP without it, if using current version of the EFI)

#### IMPORTANT

Please generate a new SMBIOS (MacBookPro16,1 or MacBookPro16,4) as I deleted my serials.
