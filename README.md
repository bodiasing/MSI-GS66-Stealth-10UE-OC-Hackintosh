# MSI-GS66-Stealth-10UE-OC-Hackintosh

# UPDATE "EFI UPDATE"
I replaced voodoohda.kext with applealc.kext and use verbstub.kext.

But you need to install ComboJackfix (included in "EFI UPDATE").

Your folder path must be, my folder path is specified in the terminal.

Installation in the terminal:

cd ~/Downloads/ComboJackfix    

sh install.sh

#### To enter the Advanced BIOS
Not necessarily, but I updated the BIOS on the latest version of E16V3IMS.111, and undervolted -105 mv.
While in the BIOS, press F2, Left ALT, Right SHIFT, Right CTRL
Now you can verify that DVMT Pre-Allocated is set to 64MB and DVMT Total Gfx Mem is set to Max. Disabled Fast boot and Secure boot.
Also, and most important, set CFG Lock to Disabled, to enable native PM (also you would probably get a KP without it, if using current version of the EFI)

My bios settings:

DVMT Pre-Allocated is set to 64MB

DVMT Total Gfx Mem is set to Max Also

CFG Lock to Disabled

Secure boot - disable
